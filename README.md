# Ecommerce Website Project - Frontend

### Description

Client side of Ecommerce Website project(Prime Connect). It was made using `create-react-app` and it uses redux for state management and also axios for sending asynchronous requests to the backend. This is a progressive web app with a lot of focus on better performance, accessibility, SEO and best practices (lighthouse extention).
For better managing the redux state, redux-toolkit was used.
For better performance, icons and fonts are local.
Admins of the website have access to charts allowing them to make data-driven choices.
Blurhash technology was used to encode (backend) and decode images for lazy loading and better user exprience.
validator library was used for a client side validation of credit cards.
